# Comprehensive Full-Stack Project Guide

This guide outlines a series of full-stack projects, reordered by increasing difficulty, to help you build a diverse and convincing resume. Each project includes a background, core concepts, valuable technologies, and a detailed, day-by-day development checklist to facilitate progress tracking.

### Project 1 (Beginner): Social Media Dashboard

**Difficulty:** ★☆☆☆☆ (Excellent for mastering core CRUD operations, API design, and database relationships.)

**Project Background:**
A niche social media platform for a specific community (e.g., designers, developers). Users can share posts, follow others, and engage in discussions. The goal is to build a solid foundation in full-stack principles.

**Recommended Tech Stacks:**

- **Stack 1 (The "MERN" Stack):** A great choice for a cohesive JavaScript/TypeScript experience.
  - **Frontend:** React (with Vite)
  - **Backend:** Node.js with Express
  - **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Stack 2 (The Python/Django Stack):** Excellent for rapid, robust backend development.
  - **Frontend:** React or Vue.js
  - **Backend:** Python with Django REST Framework
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL

**Detailed Development Checklist (2 Weeks):**

- **Day 1: Planning & Schema**
  - [ ] Finalize feature list (e.g., posts with text, user profiles, follows).
  - [ ] Draw a database schema diagram with tables for `users`, `posts`, `follows`, `likes`, and `comments`, including fields and relationships.
  - [ ] Create a new Git repository on GitHub and clone it locally.
- **Day 2: Backend Project Setup**
  - [ ] Initialize the backend project (e.g., `npm init`, `django-admin startproject`).
  - [ ] Install core dependencies (Express/Django, ORM, dotenv).
  - [ ] Configure environment variables (`.env`) and database connection.
  - [ ] Create a basic `/` health-check route that returns "API is running".
- **Day 3: User Registration API**
  - [ ] Create the `POST /api/auth/register` route.
  - [ ] Implement input validation (email format, password length).
  - [ ] Implement password hashing (e.g., using `bcrypt`).
  - [ ] Write the logic to save the new user to the database.
  - [ ] Test the endpoint with an API client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia).
- **Day 4: User Login API**
  - [ ] Create the `POST /api/auth/login` route.
  - [ ] Implement logic to find the user by email and compare the hashed password.
  - [ ] Generate and return a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login.
  - [ ] Test the endpoint.
- **Day 5: User Profile API & Auth Middleware**
  - [ ] Create middleware to verify the JWT from request headers and attach the user to the request object.
  - [ ] Create a protected `GET /api/users/me` route to get the current user's profile.
  - [ ] Create a protected `PUT /api/users/me` route to update profile details.
- **Day 6: Post Creation & Retrieval API**
  - [ ] Create a protected `POST /api/posts` route for creating a new post.
  - [ ] Create a public `GET /api/posts` route to fetch all posts for the main feed.
  - [ ] Create a public `GET /api/posts/:id` route to fetch a single post.
- **Day 7: Post Update & Delete API**
  - [ ] Create a protected `PUT /api/posts/:id` route, ensuring only the post's author can edit.
  - [ ] Create a protected `DELETE /api/posts/:id` route, ensuring only the post's author can delete.
- **Day 8: Frontend Setup & Auth UI**
  - [ ] Initialize the frontend project (e.g., using Vite or Create React App).
  - [ ] Build the UI components for the Registration and Login pages.
  - [ ] Implement the client-side logic to call the register/login APIs and store the JWT in local storage.
- **Day 9: Frontend Feed & Post Display**
  - [ ] Build the main feed page UI.
  - [ ] Fetch and display all posts from the `GET /api/posts` endpoint.
  - [ ] Create a reusable component to display a single post's content.
- **Day 10: Frontend Profile Page**
  - [ ] Build the user profile page UI.
  - [ ] Fetch and display a specific user's information and all of their posts.
- **Day 11: Follows API & Integration**
  - [ ] Create protected `POST /api/users/:id/follow` and `DELETE /api/users/:id/follow` endpoints.
  - [ ] Add a "Follow/Unfollow" button to the profile page UI and connect it to the API.
- **Day 12: Likes & Comments API & Integration**
  - [ ] Create API endpoints for liking/unliking posts and adding comments.
  - [ ] Add UI elements to the post component for likes and comments and connect them to the new APIs.
- **Day 13: Styling & Responsiveness**
  - [ ] Apply a consistent styling system (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI) across the application.
  - [ ] Use media queries or framework features to ensure the app is usable on both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- **Day 14: Docker & Deployment**
  - [ ] Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend service.
  - [ ] Write a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy local development.
  - [ ] Deploy the backend to a service like Heroku or Fly.io.
  - [ ] Deploy the frontend to a service like Vercel or Netlify.
